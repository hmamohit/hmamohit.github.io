Why Robin?
==========
* Chromosome loop analysis has emerged in the interest of researchers in recent years.  

* Recently, our lab published a comparative study, Chowdhury et al. 2024, where we compared different types of loop caller tools: Â  `Comparative study on chromatin loop callers using Hi-C data reveals their effectiveness <https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-024-05713-w>`_ 

* Since we published this comparative study,  Chowdhury et al. 2024, there has been much demand for the code and for a ready-to-use on-the-go platform to reproduce the analysis results for future loop caller analysis.

* Hence, we propose Robin to meet this demand.

Robin has been developed to serve as a reliable and easy to use platform that fulfills the need for a comparable and powerful loop caller analysis tool. The plots created by Robin for analysis are of good quality and are publication ready. Overall, Robin is:
    * User-friendly and easy to use with a modern web interface.
    * Removes boilerplate codes for different analyses.
    * Provides downloadable high-resolution plots.
    * Provides ready-to-use plots for loop caller analysis such as Overlap, Regression, and Recovery plots.
    * HiGlass integrated to visualize the loop caller results with different ChIP signals.
    * LLM integrated that allows the users to generate more plots with their needs using the uploaded data.
