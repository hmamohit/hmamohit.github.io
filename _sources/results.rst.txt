==================
A brief usecase for each of the results is provided in our paper (*H. M. A. Mohit Chowdhury, Mattie Fuller and Oluwatosin Oluwadare. Robin:  An Advanced Tool for Comparative Loop Caller Analysis Leveraging Large Language Models (under review)*).

For a comprehensive expalanation and interepretation of eah plots, please review: **Chowdhury, H.M.A.M., Boult, T. & Oluwadare, O.

Regression
--------------
    Regression plots shows the stastical correlation among the tools considering the resolutions.

    * It shows the Average Bin Size (of the number of bins) vs. Resolution. 
    * It shows the Average Bin Size (of the number of bins in KB) vs. Resolution. 
    * It shows the regression plots.
    * It shows the category regression plots.
