Welcome to Robin
=================================
Robin is a web interface designed to analyze loop caller results. With the results generated by their tools, users don't have to worry about writing all the boilerplate code needed for analysis. Additionally, our web interface is linked with Large Language Model (LLM) to provide the user with simple-to-follow writing instructions. Robin is developed by `Oluwadare Lab <https://uccs-bioinformatics.com/>`_.
